# User Disconnect Cleanup Implementation

## Problem

When users closed their browser tab, they remained in the voice channel participant list forever because the disconnect handler wasn't properly cleaning up.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced WebSocket Disconnect Handler

**File**: `backend/src/websocket/websocket.ts`

Made `handleDisconnect` async and added:

-   **SFU Resource Cleanup**: Calls `sfuService.cleanup(channelId, userId)` to remove mediasoup transports, producers, and consumers
-   **Participant List Cleanup**: Removes user from `voiceParticipants` map
-   **Event Broadcasting**: Broadcasts `user_left` event with updated participant list to remaining users
-   **Error Handling**: Try-catch around SFU cleanup with detailed logging

```typescript
private async handleDisconnect(clientId: string) {
    // ... extract user info ...

    if (voiceState?.channelId) {
        // 1. Clean up SFU resources
        if (this.sfuService) {
            try {
                await this.sfuService.cleanup(channelId, userId);
                console.log(`🧹 SFU cleanup completed for user ${username}`);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(`❌ SFU cleanup failed:`, error);
            }
        }

        // 2. Remove from participant list
        const filteredParticipants = participants.filter((p) => p.userId !== userId);
        voiceParticipants.set(channelId, filteredParticipants);

        // 3. Broadcast user_left to remaining participants
        this.broadcastToChannel(channelId, {
            type: 'voice_state',
            data: { type: 'user_left', channelId, userId, username, participants: filteredParticipants }
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Added SFU Service Integration

**File**: `backend/src/websocket/websocket.ts`

Added bidirectional service connection:

```typescript
private sfuService: SFUService | null = null;

setSFUService(sfuService: SFUService) {
    this.sfuService = sfuService;
}
```

### 3. Wired Up Services in Initialization

**File**: `backend/src/index.ts`

Connected the services after initialization:

```typescript
await sfuService.init();
sfuService.setWebSocketManager(wsManager);
wsManager.setSFUService(sfuService); // ← NEW: Enables cleanup on disconnect
console.log('✅ SFU service connected to WebSocketManager');
```

### 4. Updated WebSocket Close Event Handler

**File**: `backend/src/websocket/websocket.ts`

Made disconnect handler async-aware:

```typescript
ws.on('close', () => {
    // Fire and forget async cleanup
    this.handleDisconnect(clientId).catch((error) => {
        console.error(`❌ Error during disconnect cleanup for ${clientId}:`, error);
    });
});
```

## What Gets Cleaned Up

1. **SFU Resources** (via `sfuService.cleanup()`):

    - WebRTC transports (send/receive)
    - Media producers (audio/video)
    - Media consumers (subscriptions to other users)

2. **WebSocket State**:

    - Removes user from `voiceParticipants` map
    - Deletes `voiceStates` entry
    - Removes from channel client lists

3. **Frontend Update**:
    - Remaining users receive `user_left` event
    - Frontend removes disconnected user from participant list
    - Audio elements and peer connections cleaned up

## Logs to Expect

```bash
🔌 Client disconnected: client-123 (user: john_doe)
🧹 SFU cleanup completed for user john_doe in channel voice-1
👋 User john_doe (user-456) removed from voice channel voice-1 on disconnect
   Remaining participants: [ 'alice', 'bob' ]
```

## Testing

1. Open two browser tabs, both join voice channel
2. Close one tab
3. Check backend logs for cleanup messages
4. Check other tab - should see user removed from participant list
5. Verify no mediasoup resources leaked (check SFU cleanup logs)

## Error Scenarios

-   **SFU cleanup fails**: Logs error but continues with participant list cleanup
-   **User not in voice channel**: Skips cleanup silently
-   **WebSocket close error**: Caught and logged without crashing server

## Production Deployment

```bash
cd ~/hype/backend
git pull origin develop
pnpm build
pm2 restart hype-backend
pm2 logs hype-backend --lines 100
```

Watch for `🧹 SFU cleanup completed` and `👋 User removed from voice channel` logs.
