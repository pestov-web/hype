feat(backend): implement automatic user cleanup on disconnect

- Made handleDisconnect async to await SFU resource cleanup
- Added sfuService.cleanup() call to remove mediasoup transports/producers/consumers
- Remove disconnected users from voiceParticipants map
- Broadcast user_left event with updated participant list
- Added setSFUService() to WebSocketManager for bidirectional service connection
- Wire up SFU service in index.ts initialization

Fixes issue where users remained in voice channel participant list after closing browser.

Files changed:
- backend/src/websocket/websocket.ts (enhanced handleDisconnect, added setSFUService)
- backend/src/index.ts (connect wsManager and sfuService)
- docs/DISCONNECT_CLEANUP.md (implementation documentation)
- docs/DEPLOY_DISCONNECT_CLEANUP.md (deployment checklist)
```

## Summary of Changes

### Problem

Users closing browser tabs remained in voice channel participant lists indefinitely, causing:

-   Incorrect participant counts
-   Memory leaks (mediasoup resources not cleaned up)
-   Confusing UI for remaining users

### Solution

1. **Async Disconnect Handler**: Made `handleDisconnect` async to properly await SFU cleanup
2. **SFU Resource Cleanup**: Call `sfuService.cleanup()` to remove WebRTC transports, producers, consumers
3. **Participant List Cleanup**: Remove user from `voiceParticipants` map
4. **Event Broadcasting**: Broadcast `user_left` with updated participant list to remaining users
5. **Service Integration**: Added bidirectional connection between WebSocketManager and SFUService

### Technical Details

-   **Async/Await**: WebSocket close handler uses fire-and-forget pattern with error catching
-   **Error Handling**: Try-catch around SFU cleanup to prevent crash on cleanup failure
-   **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging (user removed, remaining participants, cleanup status)
-   **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality unchanged, only adds cleanup logic

### Testing

1. Open two tabs, both join voice channel
2. Close one tab
3. Backend logs show: `üßπ SFU cleanup completed`, `üëã User removed from voice channel`
4. Other tab sees user removed from participant list
5. No mediasoup resource leaks

### Deployment

```bash
cd ~/hype/backend
git pull origin develop
pnpm build
pm2 restart hype-backend
pm2 logs hype-backend --lines 100
```

### Monitoring

Watch for:

-   `‚úÖ SFU service connected to WebSocketManager` on startup
-   `üßπ SFU cleanup completed` on user disconnect
-   `üëã User removed from voice channel` on user disconnect
-   `‚ùå SFU cleanup failed` (indicates problem)
